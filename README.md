#### Hi there, welcome to my Github profile ðŸ‘‹

I am a frontend developer and passionate programmer. I enjoy the process of learning and the challenges that come with building meaningful applications. Pretty much all of the projects post here on this Github account are back when I was in my coding bootcamps (can't share private client work), though perhaps I'll rebuild one of my personal private projects in a public repo so things start appearing on my chart.
